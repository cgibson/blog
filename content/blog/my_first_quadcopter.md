Header: Chronicling my initial foray into the world of multi-rotors.
Summary: Building a multi-rotor from scratch means I can easily replace broken components without breaking the bank. It also means I can hand-pick the pieces to meet my purposes _(acrobatics, FPV, arial photography, etc...)_. At first, I was eying components that put the copter into the $600-$700, however it has become increasingly apparent to me that one can create a reliable and performant quadcopter for $200 or less, if you know where to look.

Building a quadcopter as a personal project. While the over-the-shelf options are entertaining _(The [Blade Nano Qx][nano_qx] is a great indoor nanocopter)_, any serious model is far too expensive and not easily modifiable.

### Current Build

| | | |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| __Frame:__ | [HobbyKing Q450][frame] | $15 |
| __Flight Controller:__ | [MultiWii Pro w/GPS][flight_controller] | $65 |
| __Motors:__ | [SunnySky 1260Kv][motors] (4x) |  $18 |
| __Speed Controllers:__ | [DYS SimonK Program 30A ESCs][esc] (4x) | $14 |
| __Battery:__ | [Glacier 30C 2200mAh][battery] | $22 |
| __Transmitter/Receiver:__ | [Turnigy 9X][transmitter] | $65 |
| __Props:__ | [GemFan 8x4.5][gemfan] | $2 |

In total, after buying the above components (along with a soldering iron, LiPo charger, and a half-dozen other components) I was set back about $450. I didn't buy the cheapest parts, you could drop the cost down another $50-$100 if you worked at it. However, compared to the over-the-counter devices, you'll be flying around with more money in your wallet.

The Q450 frame is simply a clone of the more expensive DJI 450. I'm planning on upgrading to another more FPV-friendly frame _(perhaps the [Hoverthings Flip FPV][flip_fpv])_ and keeping the current one for testing and acrobatics.

I will post more information as the build progresses.
