##I'm an idea guy.
I remember drawing stickman comics when I was nine. I had dozens of pages of comics featuring two stick figures in particular. One had an 'N' in its head, and one with an 'S'. These letters were clearly initials, but their original names have been lost in time. At that age, if I thought of a funny joke, story idea, or concept, I would pull out my sketchbook and write it down.

Around the same time, I made numerous videos where my childhood friend and I would perform magic tricks, mix tapes where another friend and I *"DJ'd" (I use this term EXTREMELY loosely)* during sleepovers. I would do terrible impressions from famous singers. It didn't matter that I was good... it was fun.

Later, I would take a cartooning class with one of my all-time favorite teachers, Mr Hurd. Drawing for class assignments felt like I was cheating the system. I drew strange characters, odd scenes and unique worlds. I was proud of my work, I could see myself getting better, and with that practice I felt the growing courage to try more ambitious projects.

I created. Pen met paper. Sure, things weren't perfect, but you learn from your failures. Failure was just a part of learning and becoming better.

##So what happened?
It took me years to finally identify the trend. I never quite stopped trying to tell a story, be it through traditional art, short stories, video games... Storytelling is a passion, as anyone who has heard me talk knows full well.

I had three composition books devoted to writing ideas. I created them during a particularly successful writing binge, where I outlined several stories that I continue to build upon and play with today. However, years later I open these notebooks that I've carried all around with me and found that almost every idea had been ripped out as I *purged* bad ideas, with the intention to fill the rest of the pages with better and greater ideas.

Despite the buzz of ideas in my head, the rest of the pages were empty. So why had I never put those ideas down on paper? Why hadn't I explored them further than repeating the same internal "trailers" that I would envision everytime particular songs started playing on my MP3 player?

##At what point did I begin to view failure as a bad thing?
We're taught early on in school to use our imagination, told we are special and that we can achieve our dreams. The concepts of "hope" and "wonder" have magical properties, and dreams really do come true.

I'm not saying that we were lied to, but we were certainly given a simplified view of how things work. I would look back at my older art and cringe. I would even feel self consious because I remember printing out line-art that I had drawn so my little siblings could color them. I used to be so proud of my work, but as I grew up my expectations changed.

Had I simply acquired a better taste for art? Was I more well-read? Or was it the results-oriented teaching style most higher education that disallusioned me to the prospect of trying *(and failing)* to make my own works? Regardless of the reason *(it is likely a combination of the above, combined with a dose of self-consiousness)*, I realized that my creative outlet had dried up simply because I was afraid to fail, and had set absurdly high expectations on myself.

##What helps?
I have identified two major elements in my life that improve my situation:

First, I find discussing my ideas and bouncing early concepts off of friends and family has helped me considerably. Someone looking in from the outside can offer alternative perspectives on your ideas, can reaffirm them, or warn you if they are going in a bad direction. I've spent over a year co-writing a story with a close friend, and I have found it to be one of the more rewarding activities in my life, partially because I now have a reason to be held accountable to my work.

Another great encouraging activity is NaNoWriMo. National Novel Writing Month is an event in November where writers attempt to write 50,000 words in 30 days. The goal is quantity vs quality... forcing writers to get words onto paper without worrying about the consequences. It is so easy for us to second guess ourselves, or to worry that our work won't be good enough the first time around. NaNoWriMo fixes this by affixing a crazy deadline, giving you literally no room to edit or do over your work.

Both of the examples above involve forcing myself into particular regimens, but at the core it comes down to one important concept: practice. I'll never get better at anything unless I practice, and practice a lot. It's so easy to judge your current crappy work, but another thing entirely to realize that you work **has** to suck before you can *not* suck.

##What do I plan on doing?
For one thing, I'm setting achievable goals to get myself writing, drawing, or brainstorming every day. I would like to make writing on this blog a common practice, rather than a sporadic one.

To put it bluntly, I need to create a lot of work, and it will start out really crappy, but hopefully with repetition and experience, it will get better, and I will be a better person for it.

I haven't quite solidified my goals, but as soon as they come, they'll appear here. Thanks for reading!
