Summary: The best movie trailers show enough to catch your interest, stir your imagination, draw forth emotion, but not spoil the plot. This is in diametric opposition to most modern trailers, which seem to feel that revealing plot twists and secrets is key to capturing the interest and attention of the audience. Other movies, in an attempt to hide the true nature of the film for some artsy fartsy reason (or to hide the fact that their plot sucks), end up flat out lying to the audience, which is just as bad. <p>There was a point while watching _Captain America: The Winter Soldier_ when I realized that I had been mislead, but in the best of ways.

## The Cap is back! Prepare to be surprised
The best movie trailers show enough to catch your interest, stir your imagination, draw forth emotion, but not spoil the plot. This is in diametric opposition to most modern trailers, which seem to feel that revealing plot twists and secrets is key to capturing the interest and attention of the audience. Other movies, in an attempt to hide the true nature of the film for some artsy fartsy reason (or to hide the fact that their plot sucks), end up flat out lying to the audience, which is just as bad.

There was a point while watching _Captain America: The Winter Soldier_ when I realized that I had been mislead, but in the best of ways.

Just like how _Cabin in the Woods_ was a horror inside a comedy inside a conspiracy inside yet another horror, this movie cut its advertisements perfectly to show enough truth to get you interested, but hid all of the goodies for your viewing pleasure! Don't worry, I will do my best to leave the surprise in its box.

## Captain America wasn't sure if it wanted black-and-white villains or a splatter of gray. It went with both.
If you've seen the trailer, you know that the movie plays off several current topics shaping the world today. Surveillence, justice, who you consider "the enemy" and when. This movie is shot full of hard hitting questions. In fact, the movie is almost _too_ clever for its own writing.

The movie falls back on the more traditional totally-evil style villains at some point after the first act. At that point, while it feels familiar to the original, it loses a bit of the edge of the statement it was trying to push on its audience.

That being said, the plot was intense and the characters were fun. It was great seeing the Cap back in action. While I liked the original, this one is at least on-par in my mind.

## Not terrible 3D. Not impressive, either.
I watched the movie in IMAX 3D, and I have to say overall this wasn't the best movie to watch in that setting. The scenes were all telephoto or narrow shots, so the large screen made me feel almost a little dizzy during early action sequences. Additionally, they used an **enormous** amount of shallow focus, and heavily blurred objects in the foreground really caused havoc with the 3D upconvert.

Problems similar to the _Thor 2_ upconvert were also present whenever fuzzy or high-detail objects (like chain-linked fences) caused haloing or strange depth artifacts.

Overall, while I enjoyed the experience, you're best seeing this in 2D.

## Final Verdict
The film was slathered in great visuals _(slightly marred by limitations by a shoddy 3D upconvert)_, contained an unexpectedly complex yet intense plot, and was sprinkled with comedy that was expertly timed.

There are two major recurring themes in _Captain America_: How much freedom are we willing to give up for security, and how do we know when we are no longer working with _"the good guys"_? The movie strives, but ultimately fails, to take a stand on these two issues. The "answers" (if indeed there are any) are left vague and unanswered, perhaps a better prediction of the future than we would like to admit.

Luckily, the FOURTEEN VFX STUDIOS step in at just the right moment and blow everything to smithereens, so you don't even care!

I rate _Captain America: The Winter Soldier_ **4/5**.
