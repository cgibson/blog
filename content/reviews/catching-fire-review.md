Summary: The Hunger Games series continues to impress me with how closely they follow the books. Catching Fire represents the second in the book trilogy, and continues to impress in every way. If you liked the first movie, this is a definitely must-see. It stays true to the story, true to its characters and continues to build on the interesting (and terrifying) world around them.

##An (almost) entirely loyal adaptation.
The Hunger Games series continues to impress me with how closely they follow the books. This isn't always practical and, in some cases, certain story elements don't lend themselves to film very well. Some movies manage to remain entertaining despite deviating from the novels, whereas some straight up suck.

Catching Fire represents the second in the book trilogy, and continues to impress in every way. The only serious concern I have about the movie adaptations is the decision to split the third book into two movies *(which seems to be par for the course for recent movie adaptations)*.

The new characters in the sequel are interesting and well rounded. The existing characters feel familiar and continue to grow more three dimensional *(or at least as three-dimensional as you can get while trying to kill one another)*. President Snow strikes me as a *tad* bit too comical in this movie, though I am unsure how else they should have portrayed him.

##Prelude to a revolution
The lead in to the games was longer than the first movie, but this was mostly because more of the book was focused on the consequences of the previous year's Hunger Games. With Katniss seen as not only a troublemaker, but perhaps even a symbol of defiance against the Capital, she experiences violence and cruelty both outside and inside the games.

I think the movie has set done an excellent job preparing for the third book. Part of me is concerned how the last two movies will turn out, but considering how well they executed the first two, I have no doubt in my mind it will be quite a stirring finale!

##Final thoughts
If you liked the first movie, this is a definitely must-see. It stays true to the story, true to its characters and continues to build on the interesting (and terrifying) world around them. **4.5/5**.
