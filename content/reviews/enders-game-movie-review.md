Summary: Ender's Game, the movie, was an entertaining watch, but *(surprise surprise)* ultimately failed to capture the soul of the story. The important moments between Ender and the other battle school students was heavily watered down. Sad to say, a movie faithful to the book would not become a blockbuster, would not invite such a large budget, and might never have been made at all...

Top_Note: <b>Note:</b> I'm going to pretend that my recent re-read of the first third of the Ender's Game book entitles me to make judgements on the movie based on the Book's merits <i>(It's been about 7 years since I actually read the book.)</i>
Side_Note_1: Ender's relationship with Graff wasn't quite as cold and clever as it was in the book. The director had to choose between important character building or awesome battle scenes. Hard choice.
Side_Note_2: The battle room was brought to the silver screen, <em><strong>and it was glorious</strong></em>
Side_Note_3: Hollywood, in an act of unsurprising asininity, felt there had to be more of a romance between Ender and Petra. This turned out as well as you might expect.

Ender's Game, the movie, was an entertaining watch, but *(surprise surprise)* ultimately failed to capture the soul of the story. The important moments between Ender and the other battle school students was heavily watered down.

The subtle *(and sometimes not-so-subtle, in the case of Alai and Bernard)* interactions and moments of important character building were skipped. Battle school was simplified, the intricacies of the system as a whole boiled down to its important components, but missing the zest of how these grown men treated young children.

Ender did not go through the same trials that he was forced to endure. The way they showed him being ostracized by the others involved some meaningful glances, empty threats and him sitting at a table by himself. You have to realize that what happened in the battle room, what happened with his friends, was all in relation with his own growing psyche.

Sad to say, such a movie would not become a blockbuster, would not invite such a large budget, and might never have been made at all. So if I step back and look at it from a distance and see if it struck similar chords, touched on similar issues, I would say yes, it holds to the structure of the complex problems that Ender's Game set out to address, it just didn't spend too much time on them.

## What about the visuals?
Was it pretty? *Absolutely*. Top notch visually, and I felt they conveyed Ender's battle experience in a way only visual media could have done. I'm certain this is why the director skipped all of that fluffy *"emotional"* and *"psychological"* stuff in order to focus on the shiny lasers and pretty explosions. Gotta hand it to them though, they did a bang up job. Definitely got the chills whenever they entered the battle room or the war simulations. Awesome awesome visuals. Without the visuals, the movie likely wouldn't have been worth a Bean.

Also, anyone notice how they spent this time talking about how zero-G had no *"up"*... yet the rest of the movie played out like a pre-Wrath-of-Khan Star Trek movie where they hadn't discovered the concept of a Y-axis? 

Just saying!

## Suggestion: Read the book!
If you're planning on reading the book, do it first if you can. The movie simply doesn't have the time nor the emotional sophistication to convey the kind of stuff that Ender and his crew went through. Asa Butterfield did an excellent job playing Ender (when writing permitted). Following Ender's experiences and thinking his thoughts gives you an insight that is otherwise lost. As it stands, we only see the outline of Ender's psyche... Ender's shadow.

## Final verdict
**Rating: 3.5 out of 5 stars**. For:

* **Visuals**,
* **Intensity**,
* **Harrison Ford**, and
* **Good Child Actors**

*Because seriously, who expects us to give as good a performance with 8 year olds?*
