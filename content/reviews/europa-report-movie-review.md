Author: Chris Gibson
Summary: The movie felt like a Michael Crichton novel from start to finish. It took a simple concept (sending a manned mission to Jupiter's moon, Europa) and played it out, adding some hazards and a big mystery along the way. The technology was near-future, and felt far more realistic than any other space movie I have seen (with the obvious exception of something like Apollo 13)...

Side_Note_1: Because the movie was supposed to be a compilation of real recordings from the ship, most shots had a pragmatic, utilitarian feel.
Side_Note_2: You keep questioning whether this is actually Sharlto Copley. This is, in part, because of the lack of deep social message in the movie. Oh, and his voice isn't high pitched, whiny and accented... so there's that.
Top_Note: I swear this is actually a movie review... scroll down to the bottom if you want to see what I thought about The Europa Report.

## I have a thing for Psychological Sci-Fi's.
Something about the isolation, the limited supplies, and the sheer unknowability... it can be a uniquely gripping if done well.

Many movies have gotten close. There are elements of Alien, Prometheus, Pandorum and Sunshine that I like. Most of them have one crucial flaw (with the exception of Alien). The evil guy is almost always revealed... and often gets far too much screen-time.

## Who did it right
Alien got it right the first time. Most of the interaction was with the crew... in fact you didn't even see any aliens for easily the first half hour of the movie. When you saw it, it was usually lurking in dark corners, quick glimpses... but mostly leaving bodies. You also see the hand of evil in the actions of some of the crew (notably the android). The opposition takes many forms, but there are only a few times you see the alien in the light, and most of that is near the end.

## Who did it (almost) right
Prometheus is a debatable subject. It tried to be too many things at once... trying to be a prequel while still branching off into its own story line. David's intentions are never really too clear. Yet there is still a huge human component in the movie, mingled with a bit of philosophical existentialism... but most importantly, it is co-mingled with the feeling of wonder and exploration, which is where the movie really shines in my eyes.

Pandorum has all of the makings of a really great film, except for one key element that essentially kills it: The bad guys were far too obvious, far too evil and came into the movie far too early. I won't ruin the ending, because I rather liked it, but it lost its "psychological" feel fifteen minutes in, only to regain it five minutes before the end.

Sunshine is able to keep you on the edge of your seat, and REALLY does a great job at remaining a psychological thriller until the very end. It always disappoints me when a movie tries to hard to play the psychological angle, only to reveal "surprise, it's ACTUALLY a monster" at the end. I would still say it was a good movie, despite the supernatural feel at the end that threatened to kill it.

## And now, for the actual review
And that leads me to the movie I just finished... Europa Report. This took the route of Sunshine, it was extremely intra-personal... focused very much on the people and how they react to situations, not just the situations themselves. It also took a documentary-style direction. Jumping in and out of multi-/single-camera views was interesting and haunting, and the pacing was perfect. The plot was semi-non-linear, leaving you to wonder about what happened on the ship in the intervening months... only to catch glimpses and clues in the subtle interaction and actions of the crew.

The movie felt like a Michael Crichton novel from start to finish. It took a simple concept (sending a manned mission to Jupiter's moon, Europa) and played it out, adding some hazards and a big mystery along the way. The technology was near-future, and felt far more realistic than any other space movie I have seen (with the obvious exception of something like Apollo 13).


## Final verdict
The movie is in theaters, but due to its highly limited release, they've opened it up to rentals on-demand on iTunes and Amazon Prime. I'd really suggest checking it out. It's not groundbreaking, but well done. I don't want to give anything away, but let's just say it gets a little weird near the end... but I can forgive them.

**Rating: 4 out of 5 stars**. For:

* **Actually good use of "documentary footage" style**,
* **Pacing**,
* **Sharlto Copley's missing accent**, and
* **Space**
