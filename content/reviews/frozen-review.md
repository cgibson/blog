Summary: I'm not exactly sure where to begin on this one, except that Disney did an absolutely dreadful job marketing this film. When I first watched the previews, I had absolutely zero interest in the movie. The first teaser, featuring only Olaf (the Snowman) and Sven (the Reindeer) was uninspiring and uninteresting. The feature trailers did little to assuage my concerns, often showing Olaf as a major character in an attempt to appeal to the young boy crowd. Bad move, Disneyâ€¦ there was so much more to like about this film.

##A pinch of bad marketing
I'm not exactly sure where to begin on this one, except that Disney did an absolutely dreadful job marketing this film. When I first watched the previews, I had absolutely zero interest in the movie. The first teaser, featuring only Olaf *(the Snowman)* and Sven *(the Reindeer)* was uninspiring and uninteresting. The feature trailers did little to assuage my concerns, often showing Olaf as a major character in an attempt to appeal to the young boy crowd. Bad move, Disney... there was so much more to like about this film.

The music was amazing, though perhaps a little too memorable. This is certainly not a problem for Disney, but I can't count the amount of times I've walked by little girls singing that song. **It wouldn't be so bad... except most of them simply repeat one or two verses of each song. Over and over.** Please, Disney... find us something else to listen to that doesn't require such a wide range of notes... little girls simply can't sing those songs... but they try anyway.

##Frozen breaks old norms, surprises with genuine finish
What I was most impressed with was the story. I may be in the minority on this one, but I feel like Frozen was more of a satire of its older stories than it was cliche. Near the beginning of the movie, you're almost convinced that it is still playing on the *"love at first sight"* standby, but quickly come to suspect something else entirely. But even those who think they see what's coming will be surprised at the conclusion.

Also, Olaf does appear in a lot of the movie, but almost entirely as traveling comic relief. His appearances are neither jarring nor distracting in my opinion. Good on you, Disney.

##Final verdict
With a beautiful oscar-winning score, empowering female leads, and eye-catching graphics, I think my rating of **4.5/5** is well deserved.
