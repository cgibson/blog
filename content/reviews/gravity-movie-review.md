Summary: Amazing visuals, stunning performances by Bullock and Clooney, and insane zero-G choreography that boggles the mind. You'd think falling out of orbit would be mostly a boring affair, involving a lot of spinning, hyperventilating, asphyxiating, and burning up. Well... you'd be right, but Gravity offers SO much more...

Side_Note_1: <p><strong>Pictured:</strong> Clooney in space.</p> I think his character had two emotions: amusement and something that only approached mild concern
Side_Note_2: Taken out of context, the trailer makes it look like everything Sandra Bullock touches explodes. This holds up well in the movie as well.
Side_Note_3: <p>Let's all be honest here...</p> Astronauts don't wear underwear like this during space walks. I heard zero complaints during the movie.

## In short, Gravity was a stellar movie.

Amazing visuals, stunning performances by Bullock and Clooney, and insane zero-G choreography that boggles the mind. You'd think falling out of orbit would be mostly a boring affair, involving a lot of spinning, hyperventilating, asphyxiating, and burning up. Well... you'd be right, but Gravity offers SO much more.

The 98% critic (91% user) rating it holds on rotten tomatoes is well deserved. Usually, movies with such high ratings fall into two categories: 1) they're paying off reviewers, or 2) it's trying to be too "artsy", and no critic wants to reveal that they don't ACTUALLY understand the "deep undertones" of the crappy script so they say they like it.

While it had a definite artistic flare, it didn't come off as pretentious nor was it boring... quite the opposite. It was a simple concept that didn't feel stretched to fit the 91 minute run-time. It gave you moments to breath between action scenes, but it was never long before the universe decided it had had enough of Bullock's introspection and would go back to trying to skewer her with space debris!

The movie clearly tried to get as physically probably as possible. The visuals looked pretty authentic with sharp shadows and a great attention to detail to the tech. While perhaps unlikely, Bullock and Clooney's journey feels believable, down to the shenanigans with momentum that ensue when they need to get creative. In fact, Sandra Bullock is CONSTANTLY fighting inertia and momentum and seems allergic to good luck.

The acting was pretty top notch. Having to carry most of the performance themselves, Bullock and Clooney were interesting, complex characters who right off the bat struck me as very three-dimensional and entertaining. Clooney was particularly entertaining, and Bullock really delivered the kind of heartfelt emotional performance that really draws you in.

## Beautiful, haunting music
The soundtrack definitely made up for the lack of noise in space. They REALLY loved their build ups, but those loud moments just made the relatively quiet and introspective moments stand out. It fit the movie really well.

A word of warning, this movie is not for those who suffer from motion sickness. Their excellent camera work meant they caught the spirit of zero-G, six-degrees movement.

## Final verdict
**Rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars**. For:

* **Visuals**,
* **Intensity**,
* **Sandra Bullock**, and
* **George Clooney**
