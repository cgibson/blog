Summary: The second part of a trilogy, many people were skeptical that director Peter Jackson could spread the simple story of The Hobbit across three movies without feeling boring or drawn out. I feel this movie proves them wrong. The sequel is rife with action, humor, and maybe a little (arguably unnecessary) romance...

Side_Note_1: Martin Freeman as Bilbo is as endearing and entertaining as always.
Side_Note_2: Luke Evans' Bard looks like a merging of Will Turner and Inigo Montoya. And now you see it too.
Side_Note_3: I would have paid good money to have been present for Benedict Cumberbatch's motion capture sessions... See more <a href="http://io9.com/heres-benedict-cumberbatch-doing-mo-cap-as-the-hobbit-1450360768">here!</a>

*The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug* continues Bilbo's journey to the Lonely mountains in search of a new home,
a panoply of riches, and of course a monstrous dragon! The second part of a trilogy, many people were skeptical that
director Peter Jackson could spread the simple story of The Hobbit across three movies without feeling boring or drawn
out. I feel this movie proves them wrong.

The sequel is rife with action, humor, and maybe a little romance. The story is also very well paced *(pacing was a common
criticism of the first movie)*.

A whole boat-load of new characters breath breath new life into the story. Several of the characters, such as Bard, and
 Smaug, were expected, while the elves Legolas and Tauriel stole more screen time than expected *(though who can say no to
 a little more [Orlando Bloom?][hobbits-to-isengard])*.

However, Benedict Cumberbatch's Smaug all but steals the show in the latter half the movie. After watching the movie,
I simply cannot imagine anyone else playing the role better.

## Adding on to the story
If you were bothered by the extra content that Peter Jackson added in the first movie, you'll continue to be
disappointed with the sequel.

Needless to say, the romance between two main characters was markedly missing from the
original book. If you aren't pained by Jackson's little additions you'll agree it's not a bad thing.

The movie certainly builds on Gandalf's extra-dwarvish activities. While the book has the mysterious
wizard coming and going with only rumors surrounding his activities, the movie adaptation follows Gandalf as he
investigates the rise of the Necromancer as an introduction to Sauron. I'm not so well versed in the LOTR lore as to
speculate on how closely they followed J.R.R Tolkien's writings and vision, but it seemed to fit into the story really
well.

**It is obvious that Peter Jackson is trying to create a clearly interwoven story between the Hobbit and LOTR series.
These 'side quests' are merely setting the foundation that Tolkien left out.**

I was disappointed that the Dwarves' introduction to Beorn at the beginning was so rushed and pointedly deviated
from the story *(Where they were introduced to the shifter in pairs, so as not to overwhelm him)*. Though I understand
they wanted to progress the story.

## Cinematography
As with the first movie, the cinematography is nice, but lacking a certain gravity that the Lord of the Rings had.

Admittedly, The Hobbit *is* a more juvenile story, but it's abundantly clear that Peter Jackson wants The Hobbit to fit
in with the rest of the LOTR movies. So why resort to such immature camera work such as spinning the camera while zooming
in on something concerning or evil? It makes those shots feel like something from a children's movie.

While the overall experience was very good, I would have been much happier if Mr. Jackson had simply stuck with what
had worked in the LOTR movies.

## Now, down to the visuals
While there were a few scenes I felt weren't up to par with the rest of the movie, the overall experience blew me away.

The costumes and props were top notch, certainly topping its predecessor. The environments (it's hard to call them
'sets' anymore; how much of it was physically there as opposed to green screens?) were awe-inspiring.

**Smaug was fantastic!** I cannot overemphasize what an amazing job the WETA guys did with the dragon. His enormity was
very well portrayed, while giving him an entertaining, evil elegance with which he leapt, glided or slithered around the dwarven halls.

The 3D was a mixed bag for me. I had the misfortune of watching on an uncalibrated IMAX, so the colors were offset on
my left eye making the picture appear slightly blurred and halo'd by red. This, overall, marred my 3D experience, so I
can't say much there. Luckily this was somewhat ignorable, and didn't wholly detract from my overall experience.

That being said, none of the scenes really popped out at me (which is a good thing) but it also felt like it lacked
depth. I feel they may have been a little too conservative with the 3D, or it just wasn't noticeable enough to add much
to the movie itself.

I'm still not entirely sure what I think about 48 FPS movies. It didn't have the same level of awkwardness that the
first Hobbit suffered from near the beginning, though that may have been because I had spent the last 2.5 hours
watching the first movie and was used to it. The action scenes were very impressive, and there were a lot of those!

## Final verdict
In closing, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug was a great follow-up to the original. It was well paced, included
plenty of good laughs, great action and a deliciously awesome Smaug.

I rate this movie **4.5/5**, a definite must see!
