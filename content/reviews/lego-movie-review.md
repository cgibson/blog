Summary: The LEGO movie was awesome, nostalgic fun. Not only did it do a truly wonderful job of capturing the magic of legos, but it constantly reminded me of the kind of fun fun I had with my brother when we were younger. I remember constantly building, upgrading or salvaging creations to "battle" with/against my brother. We would use arbitrary rules (a key element in any Lego playtime) to create an ever changing world that was never short on excitement.

The LEGO movie was awesome, nostalgic fun. Not only did it do a truly wonderful job of capturing the magic of legos, but it constantly reminded me of the kind of fun fun I had with my brother when we were younger. I remember constantly building, upgrading or salvaging creations to *"battle"* with/against my brother. We would use arbitrary rules *(a key element in any Lego playtime)* to create an ever changing world that was never short on excitement.

The characters were eclectic and entertaining, often playing off of others leading to an almost constant stream of puns or jokes. The world was a caricature of all of the different Lego sets that had been made over the years. Nods to all sorts of known franchises *(including a brief, brief cameo of Star Wars)* along with some of the honestly bizarre *(read: unikitty)* kept things fresh and interesting throughout the story.

##Unexpected feels
As for the story, well... let's just say you don't expect how *real* things get at one point. You'd think that a movie as crazy and hyper as Lego couldn't slow down enough to fit some real life lessons into the story, but they do, and it's remarkably touching.

The graphics were **amazing**, especially considering how truthful they were to the medium, not allowing for arbitrary movement, instead opting for more realistic movement, intentionally making the entire movie feel like some super upscale Lego stop-motion film.

##Final verdict
Everything is awesome! Especially the LEGO movie. **4.5/5.**
