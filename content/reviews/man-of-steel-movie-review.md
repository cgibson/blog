Summary: It says something when the opening clip was the part I enjoyed most about the movie. I really enjoyed the first half of the movie, before Clark lost all semblance of a living, breathing human being. Man of Steel had the makings of a good movie. However, the moment Clark became Superman, he lost what little of a soul his character had...

Side_Note_1: The movie took itself so seriously, sometimes you weren't sure if you were supposed to laugh, cringe... or both.
Side_Note_2: Seriously, make a movie entirely about this guy, ending with the collapse of Krypton. It would be amazing.
Side_Note_3: Your disguise is still terrible. No, it wouldn't work on anyone who has seen you up close.
Top_Note: I'm not really sure how Zack Snyder is going to pull off any other superman movies after this. Superman's personality and tone won't mesh well with any sort of Justice League incarnation as it stands. What does this mean? <em>ANOTHER RE-MAKE, OF COURSE!</em>

## Man of Steel was the beginnings of a great movie that simply chose to give up.
Watched Man of Steel. I really enjoyed the first half of the movie, before Clark lost all semblance of a living, breathing human being. Honestly, if they made an entire movie featuring Russell Crowe as Jor-El and the last age of Krypton just as it played out in the beginning, I'd watch the hell out of it.

As it stands, Man of Steel had the makings of a good movie, and gave a very interesting perspective of Clark's early years (the parallelism between his growing powers and the struggles of a child with autism were particularly potent.) However, the moment Clark became Superman, he lost what little of a soul his character had had. Let me explain...

## Not the superhero we came to expect
When Clark fights Zod *(No, this isn't a spoiler...)* I feel like he has little to no empathy to anyone around him, with the exception of his mother and Loise.

Let me put it this way without giving anything away... Zod could have shot down a plane filled with hundreds of innocents, and Clark would let it blow up behind him just so he could look cool while smashing Zod's face in. He didn't seem at all bound to those he was trying to protect... that was Superman's big weakness half the time.

In fact, when a character on screen noted Clark was "the most moral person [they] know", I simply shook my head. WHAT, exactly, had Clark done besides save a few people in the beginning of the movie, to be considered "the most moral man"? It didn't feel at all believable.

## When explosions and action scenes simply aren't enough.
Even the 13 boy half of me who squeals at explosions couldn't ignore the big plot holes and other cringe worthy bits sprinkled across the film. Besides the action, the last half felt flat as paper compared to what they were attempting earlier on in the film.

## Final verdict
If you like explosions and giganormouse collateral damage, it's right up your alley... But when your main character in his grown up form is more bland than some of the extras, you've got some issues to work through. I give it a C+.
