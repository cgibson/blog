Summary: On top of being straight up confusing, the lessons and themes seem vague at best, and totally contradictory at worst. Kermit, replaced by an evil frog named Constantine, isn't even missed by his friends until near the end. He is right to be mad when his friends finally come to realize he had been replaced. What kind of friends wouldn't realize that their friend had been replaced by an evil man with a russian accent? Was "family" the theme, or was it "good things come to those who wait"? Or was it "Friends stick together"...

Header: Do you know a Muppet man?

While I don't dislike the muppets, *"The Muppets: Most Wanted"* wasn't terribly high on my to-watch list, especially since I never watched the 2011 movie. I had plenty of other movies to distract me. So, three days before the release of the newest Muppet installment, I decided to catch myself up and watch the *"original" (technically the sixth sequel to the original Muppets film)*.

*"The Muppets"* surprised me in its entertaining puns, fun dance numbers, uplifting characters and recognizable cameos. I was able to turn my brain off and simply enjoy the movie. The movie wasn't about the plot. Everyone was just enjoying being in the film. You chuckled at the good guys, the bad guys, the random secondary characters, the silly props. The movie left you feeling good.

##Where 'Most Wanted' fell short
In comparison, *"The Muppets: Most Wanted"* felt *(if possible)* more overwhelming and confusing. It was clear from the get-go that the movie had a ton of heart, and there were legitimately hilarious scenes, but it felt disconnected and strange. The first movie was pleasant in its simplicity, even if that simplicity was covered up by crazy puppet shenanigans, but the sequel felt borderline schizophrenic.

On top of being straight up confusing, the lessons and themes seem vague at best, and totally contradictory at worst. Kermit, replaced by an evil frog named Constantine, isn't even missed by his friends until near the end. He is right to be mad when his friends finally come to realize he had been replaced. What kind of friends wouldn't realize that their friend had been replaced by an evil man with a russian accent? Was *"family sticks together"* the theme, or was it *"good things come to those who wait"*? ...Or was it *"Friends stick together"*...

##Final Verdict

Overall, the movie failed to achieve a simple, straightforward plot, opting for a complexity unnecessary for the type of movie they were going for. They also failed to convey a clear theme, the characters didn't learn a well defined lesson, and the challenge they end up overcoming *(Constantine)* seems very contrived, even for a children's movie. There were some great laughs, fun cameos, but **I think the Muppets sequel simply wanted to be too many things, and ended up as an only mediocre sequel.**

I rate this **2.5/5**. Fans will undoubtedly find something they like in this movie, but I don't suggest seeing it in theaters.
