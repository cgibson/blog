Title: Non-Stop
Heading: Liam Neeson beating people up on a plane.
Tags: movie, review

Author: Chris Gibson
Summary: Just the concept of multiple homicides occurring on an international flight, especially with two air marshals, seems ludicrous to begin with. Add in some sort of conspiracy to blame Liam's character on â€˜hijacking' the plane, and you begin to see why this movie relies more on its suspenseful nature and entertaining characters than its deep plot.

##Let's talk about actor bias...
I have a confession to make: I sometimes watch movies, even bad ones, simply because I know a certain actor is going to be in it. Nicolas Cage, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, Keanu Reeves... I don't watch these movies because they are good, I watch them because they tend to entertain me. Among that list of actors, I also include Liam Neeson.

I enjoy watching Liam Neeson beat people up. So when I saw the trailer for Non-Stop, I knew I would have to watch it, despite some of the glaring issues that were present even in the trailers themselves.

Just the concept of multiple homicides occurring on an international flight, especially with two air marshals, seems ludicrous to begin with. Add in some sort of conspiracy to blame Liam's character on *"hijacking"* the plane, and you begin to see why this movie relies more on its suspenseful nature and entertaining characters than its deep plot.

##Next stop: reality check
The plot continues to grow more and more outlandish, culminating in unnecessary passenger treatment, highly unlikely interactions between crewmembers, and a particularly bad *"hacking"* scene. The last 15 minutes are so crazy and unbelievable *(even after accepting the original premise)* that it's hard to take this film seriously, especially considering the serious questions the antagonists pose.

##Final thoughts
However, despite all this, I enjoyed the movie. *"Taken on a Plane"* may not have been believable, but it feeds my actor bias, and Liam played his part perfectly. **3/5.**
