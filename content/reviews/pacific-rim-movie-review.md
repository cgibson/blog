Summary: Went to see Pacific Rim last night with some friends. The movie rivaled, if not beat, the Avengers in how many times it managed to get the crowd to clap and cheer. Granted, Del Toro very effectively hones in on the little destruction-loving child inside all of us. Combine that with his passion for awesome monsters and an impressive budget, how can you NOT leave this movie grinning?

Side_Note_1: So many scenes in this movie sent chills down my spine, made me laugh, clap or grin like mad.
Side_Note_2: By far my two favorite characters in the film. They popped up here and there, acting like comedic duct tape to help hold the story together and give us a breather from the constant action scenes.
Side_Note_3: Ron Perlman, played by Ron Perlman

Went to see Pacific Rim last night with some friends. The movie rivaled, if not beat, the Avengers in how many times it managed to get the crowd to clap and cheer. Granted, Del Toro very effectively hones in on the little destruction-loving child inside all of us. Combine that with his passion for awesome monsters and an impressive budget, how can you NOT leave this movie grinning? (Don't worry... no spoilers below)

The opening scene sets the tone for the entire movie, playing a 90's rock battle anthem akin to the StarCraft soundtrack (which continues throughout the entire movie, more or less.) This, along with the corny introduction, was basically Del Toro patting us on the shoulder saying "I know exactly what you want... enjoy your next two hours!".

The main characters actually have a pretty dull interaction, though I'm very happy they avoided falling into the typical flat sex-filled romance that Hollywood is so keen on. It's actually the side characters that are the most fun. The science researchers are excellent example, they're caricatures of their profession, strange and zany to the extreme. And Ron Perlman is... well... Ron Perlman. They just fit the bill, never taking themselves too seriously.

## Pacific Rim never takes itself too seriously
Every once in a while there will be a break in the action/drama that will cause the theater to laugh, or at least give one of those half-chuckle/half-groans.

In fact, the entire movie gave me the feeling that they brought one of the directors of a Schwarzenegger 90's sci-fi into the future, handed him $200 million and modern tech and said "enjoy." And that's exactly what I wanted from this movie!

## Final verdict
At the end of the day, this won't win any story or acting awards (ANY). But if you went to Pac Rim looking for amazing acting, you clearly didn't pay attention to the trailers . There's awesome action, BEAUTIFUL effects, an exciting (if not deep) story and enough humor to keep you entertained all the way through.
