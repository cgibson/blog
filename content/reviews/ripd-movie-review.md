Summary: We should have seen the signs when we were handed free shirts that were clearly meant for the employees, but clearly they didn't want to be caught DEAD in them. The premise had already begun to smell by the time we got past the first five minutes. The true CASUALTY was the possibility of what the movie could have been...

Side_Note_1: Interesting creature concepts marred by terrible acting and screen writing. The bad guys acted as if they had just escaped out of a children's cartoon.
Side_Note_2: I'm pretty sure Jeff Bridges enjoyed the filming of this movie, regardless of how big a piece of junk it was.
Side_Note_3: I'm pretty this was the most positive expression I wore during the entire movie.
Top_Note: This movie had so much potential. <strong> DO NOT SEE IT. IT IS DREADFUL. </strong>

## R.I.P.D. is DEAD on arrival.
We should have seen the signs when we were handed free shirts that were clearly meant for the employees, but clearly they didn't want to be caught **DEAD** in them. When we walked into the theater to take our seats, one could say it resembled a **GHOST-TOWN**.

## Failure to start
The premise had already begun to smell by the time we got past the first five minutes. The true **CASUALTY** was the possibility of what the movie could have been. The movie was so set to be a new Men in Black.. it had a quirky cast and a fun style... in fact all of the key elements were there, but the end result was nowhere near palatable.

The humor had terrible timing, and the moments they got chuckles out of us were accompanied with half groans. The possibly awesome pairing of Reynolds and Bridges falls flat without any good writing to support it. Kevin Bacon even feels too-good for the character they had him portray. Overall, a good potential cast **BURIED** by a movie that really shouldn't have taken itself too seriously.

The generic baddies were even worse. Most of them were cackling and making stupid sounding noises whenever they were on camera. Their clearly CG bodies jerked and shifted in unnatural ways, even for the **DEADIES** they were.

## Law's of nature? What laws?
The physics of the movie are what I really don't get. Almost every falling car or crumbling building looked strange and out of place, as if the artists were more interested in having them move the way THEY wanted and less on what would look even remotely possible. Even before he dies, Reynold's character (like every after-life good) bounces around in a very unconvincing **LIFELESS** way.

Finally, the VFX, while not the worst I have seen, was certainly cringeworthy. There were several scenes that looked like they had run out of funding and asked a few interns to give it their darndest. The result was **GRIM** to say the least.

## Final verdict
I finally found out what the movie actually stood for... **"R.I.P.D Is Positively Dreadful."** As you can see, it just recurses into oblivion... let's just hope it stays there.
