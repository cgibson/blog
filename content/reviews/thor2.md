Thor: The Dark World was a clean and fitting addition to the Thor universe. After having incarcerated Loki and bringing peace to the realms, Thor is called upon once again when Jane Foster, his human love interest, becomes yet again embroiled in things much bigger than her.

The visuals are impressive as usual, and the design of the dark elf ships are unique and interesting, bringing variety to the visual palette.

While the sequel doesn't stand out as groundbreaking, it feels like enough is different, enough is new for us to continue to enjoy the world.

## Speaking of dark elf ships...

Honestly, how did the Asgardians even win the **first** war against the dark elves at all? You'll find during the movie how... robust their ships are (they slice through buildings like butter). And after seeing the havoc they wreak in small numbers, it boggles the mind that they lost the first war to a bunch of sword swinging, hammer throwing vikings.

## The Characters
As far as characters go, Thor is the most boring of the lot. Loki, on the other hand, gets much more screen time and truly steals the show, both the actor and the colorful character he portrays. Thor's persona, on the other hand, has basically zero character arc, and is actually a bit less funny than in previous movies.

In the trailer, you find out that Thor has to come to his imprisoned brother for help. I think we all know where this is going, Loki being the God of betrayal and silly hats and all... so the plot feels a little <em>expected</em>. Sure, they send you some curve balls, but things essentially head in the direction you expect.

## Biggest Deus Ex Machina (No spoilers)
I'm not really sure I like the movie's <em>"Call to Action"</em> (a typical point in a story where the hero is forced to act). As you can expect, it involves Thor's love interest with the human girl Jane Foster. Sufficed to say, it felt forced and awkward. There's some hand waving to explain away what happened, but it was never on solid ground.

In fact, the evil plot *(again, keeping things spoilerless)* perpetrated by the villain felt equally shaky. It was never fully explained what to expect if the dark elves got what they wanted. It's always so convenient that bad guys have to "charge up" their evil device, giving heros time to save the day. No better example than the last 30 minutes of Thor...

## The Graphics
I'm torn. On one hand, the graphics were great... They continue to build on the Thor universe adding stranger bad guys and cooler ships. I loved the design and look of the dark elf ships (Though Space Sword might be a more apt description, considering all they seem to do is cut through things.)

However, we watched Thor 2 in 3D, and the up-convert was absolutely **horrendous**. Thor's messy hair was a disaster, half the time it seemed as if there was a fuzzy halo around his head (specifically in the throne room scenes). There were also times in the throne room where Loki's feet seemed to be floating off the ground.

Up-convert nastiness aside, there were a few scenes where the lighting ranged from lackluster to downright lazy. During one scene, when Thor is talking to Odin, you can see a dramatic different in lighting that makes Thor look like he's in a studio.

Despite these issues, the graphics overall were spectacular. I simply would advise against the 3D version.

## The ending (SPOILERS)

This section contains spoilers. <button title="Click to show/hide spoilers" type="button" onclick="if(document.getElementById('spoiler2') .style.display=='none') {document.getElementById('spoiler2') .style.display=''}else{document.getElementById('spoiler2') .style.display='none'}">Show/hide</button>

<div id="spoiler2" style="display:none">
<p>I think the post-credit scene when Odin is revealed to be Loki in disguise was unexpectedly powerful. First off, you realize that Loki had faked his own death (obviously to avoid being taken back and put back in prison, as Odin would likely have done).</p>

<p>It also brings into question most of Loki's actions and intentions. We were led to believe that he didn't intentionally send the monster after his mother, so we can assume at least some of his grief was real, but how much? Would he have really sacrificed himself for his brother when it came down to it?</p>

<p>It also begs a more uncomfortable question... what happened to Odin? Did Loki actually murder his father, or trap him somewhere? How much 'humanity' (bad choice of words here) is left in him?</p>

## Final verdict

Thor was fun as I expected, but played it safe. Nothing fantastic, just entertaining. Overall, I'd rate Thor 2 a 3.5/5 for:

* **A good, creative sequel**
* **Space-sword ships**
* **Loki**
